**Core React Native Components**

```
(a)View


It is like a div in the HTML World.

You can style it or wrap other elements with it.

It is the most basic component in React Native.

Views can be nested into each Other so that i can build each layout i want.

```

```
(b)Text

It is used for outputting Text.

All the Text must be in this <Text> component.


This is a rule.


A view is mainly there to apply styles or to LayOut the Component.

Wow! React native has got very little core components but we can be able to build any application
that we want as we shall see.
